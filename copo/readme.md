### COPO terms

Terms used by https://copo-project.org/api/

Note that some terms seemingly overlap with Schema.org however these are all applied at Sample level.

Some of the terms are from  Darwin Tree of Life Project's Sample Manifest Standard Operating Procedure.
<https://github.com/darwintreeoflife/metadata/blob/main/DToL_METADATA_SOP_v.2.4.pdf>
and should probably move to a different namespace
