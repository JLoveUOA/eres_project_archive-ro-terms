# ro-terms
The purpose of this repository is to allow RO-crate users to create their own RO terms without having to create a new namespace, ontologies, etc.

This way, the RO-crate community can ellaborate vocabularies in a collaborative manner. Users may collaborate to a common vocabulary (common) or create their own terms.
